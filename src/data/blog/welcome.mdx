## Welcome!

This is the second iteration of my portfolio, which I would consider to be quite the upgrade compared to my [**first one, linked here**.](https://ericyoung.vercel.app/)

<br />

This was built with Next.js and styled with Chakra-UI components. This is the second time I've used Next.js in a project and the first time working with Chakra-UI. One of the major things that stood out to me when building this is that Chakra-UI is super easy to work with thanks to the documentation and a few YouTube videos. 

<br />

What I will continue to do in this blog is to take you through my life's journey as a software engineer with updates such as what I am learning and where I am at in the job hunt!

<br />

Lastly, I'd like to thank [**Imad Atyay-Alah**](https://github.com/imadatyatalah) for being an inspiration and a resource over these past few weeks. Check the kid out if you have any spare time!
