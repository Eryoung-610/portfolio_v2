## May Update!

Hey there! This is quite the update since February's blog post. To catch you up to speed, my internship ended at the beginning of this month and while it is bittersweet, it is time for me to look for my next adventure.

<br />

Since the beginning of May, I've been preparing myself to tackle technical interviews by doing a little refresher course of [**Data Structures & Algorithms**](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/) from Udemy. This course does a great job of giving a top-level overview of various topics seen in technical interviews such as Linked Lists, Graphs, Trees, as well as certain patterns such as Multiple Pointers or Sliding Window. I finished this course roughly two weeks ago from the time this post is made and it gave me a good baseline to hop back into leetcode.

<br /> 

For a noobie like myself, hopping back into leetcode definitely got me lost and confused at certain points. Luckily there are great resources out there like the [**Tech Interview Handbook**](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/) and [**Neetcode**](https://neetcode.io/) that guide you through which problems to tackle first. I've been using The Tech Interview Handbook more often as it reads like an actual book that also includes it's own Blind 75-like problems that works with your schedule. However, Neetcode does a great job of expanding upon the Blind-75, with video solutions and links to the channel's github that contains solutions from the community in languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript and more.

<br />

While I've been studying to get myself back on my feet, I've begun applying to software engineer positions. Mainly finding them on LinkedIn, but earlier this month I got an email from an application I forgot I submitted back in March. It was Google informing me that I was eligible to take their online assessment for an early career position. I took the assessment and within a week I was moved on to the next round! While I prepare for the next round, I'm also looking into different resources to get me more prepared.

<br />

That concludes this update! Hopefully the next one is going to be when I become a noogler! :)
